# zapier-bookmarklet
A bookmarklet that document process and send the page you're reading to Zapier. Takes the URL and sends it to a Zap with a webhook trigger. Next Zap step is a code one that will do some document processing with cheerio before it's sent to a Norch /add-endpoint with another webhook.

Homepage (for testing): [Norch Zapier bookmarklet](https://eklem.github.io/zapier-bookmarklet/)

## Why
Why do we need this? I've written a little blogpost about [The volatile search engine as a use case](https://medium.com/norch/the-volatile-search-engine-as-a-use-case-b6f29b9d82ee)
