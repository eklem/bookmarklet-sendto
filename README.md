WIP - nothing working right now.

A bookmarklet that grabs the URL, title and text from the body element and send it to a service of your choice.


## Why
Why do we need this? To easily make the pages you'reinterested in searchable. I've written a little blogpost about [The volatile search engine as a use case](https://medium.com/norch/the-volatile-search-engine-as-a-use-case-b6f29b9d82ee)

Thanks to [@brunohq](https://github.com/brunohq) for his gist [zapier-webhook-bookmarklet.js](https://gist.github.com/brunohq/52d73063540ffbf79a50d71601467870)
